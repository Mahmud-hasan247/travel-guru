    "shortDescription": "Sundarbans is one of the most natural beauties of beautiful Bangladesh. This Forest is the largest mangrove forest in the world. Sundarban is a large block of littoral forests.",
    "fullDescription": "The Sundarbans was originally measured (about 200 years ago) to be of about 16,700 sq km. Now it has dwindled to about 1/3 of the original size.The history of the area can be traced back to 200–300 AD. The name Sundarban can be literally translated as 'beautiful forest' in the Bengali language. The Bangla word ‘ban’ means forest. The word ‘Sundar’ may have been derived from the ‘Sundari’ trees (the mangrove species Heritiera fomes) means of beautiful that are found in Sundarbans in large numbers."},
